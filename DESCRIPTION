Description: The HashSeq package infers true biological 16S rRNA sequence variants 
             from sequence errors generated from an Illumina sequencing instrument. 
             HashSeq utilizes a very fast HashMap-based approach to cluster sequence 
             variants with one nucleotide difference. It further uses the normal distribution 
             combined with LOESS regression to estimate background error rates as 
             a function of sequencing depth for individual clusters. The estimated error rates 
             are used to infer true sequences from the background error.
